<h1>Informational Website: Topic Proposal</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Purpose:</dt>
    <dd>The purpose of the site is to inform on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle</dd>
<dt>Audience:</dt>
    <dd>The website will be targeted specifically at college students, since it is an important transition into adulthood</dd>
<dt>Issue:</dt>
    <dd>Given that entering college almost always means less supervision and much more freedom, it is easy for students to slip into a destructive lifestyle. It is a time when good advice and support can be extremely valuable.</dd>
<dt>Content:</dt>
   <dd>The site will contain detailed guides, tips, and other knowledge on how students can take care of themselves both physically and mentally, while balancing health with academics. This includes information on dieting, exercise, time management, and mental health.</dd>
<dt>Design/Content Inspiration:</dt>
   <dd> <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.mindbodygreen.com">mindbodygreen.com:</a> The proposed website will be very similar to this site in content, in that it offers a lot of tips on wellness, except catered specifically towards college students.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">lifehacker.com:</a> This website offers helpful tips on other day-to-day activies and tasks, which is what my website will include, but more relative to college life.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.hardingscatering.co.uk/">hardingscatering.co.uk:</a> This website will be used solely as a refernce to a design that is attractive, simple yet detailed, as well as easy to navigate.</li>
    </ul>
