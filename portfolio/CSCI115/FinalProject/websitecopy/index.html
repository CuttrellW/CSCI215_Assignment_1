    <p>College is a time for dropping old habits and creating new ones. Somtimes old habits and baggage have to be dropped in order to move past a certain point in life, and college is often that point. We can think of it as a doorway, and the weight on your shoulders - whether it be guilt, fears, bad habits, - is your baggage. Often times the doorway is too small, and the weight you carry is too large for you continue. College is a time where you can drop that weight, and leave it all behind as you enter into the next chapter of your life.</p>
