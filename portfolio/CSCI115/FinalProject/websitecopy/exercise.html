<h2>Exercising in College</h2><hr>
    <p>Exercise is just as, if not more important to your physical health than healthy eating. College is the perfect place for you to get into a workout routine, and because you run your own schedule, it can be easy to make a routine that works for you. Exercise is an excellent way to start the day; it will heighten your energy levels and keep you focused throughout the rest of the day.</p>
    
<p>There is a virtually unlimited amount of workout styles and routines for you to choose from, from beginner to advanced. What's most important to a workout routine isn't the amount of time you are spending running or at the gym, but a strong consistency. By keeping your exercise routine consistent, you will see and feel a difference in your physical health over time.</p>

<h3>Goal Setting</h3>
<p>One of the most effective ways to stay on your workout routine is to set goals for yourself. You may set more than one goal, having some long term and some short term. These intermediate goals, such as completing 4 weeks of a routine consistently, will help you achieve the level of fitness that you wish to reach.</p>
    
<h3>Progressive Routine</h3>
<p>The benefit of a progressive workout routine is that it starts at a very manageable level, and slowly gets more intensive as your body develops more endurance. Here is an example of a simple progressive routine that you may change around to work with your schedule.</p>
    
    <ul class="pw"><p><b>Week 1</b></p>
    <li>Run - 1 Mile, 10:00 pace, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Push-up - 4 sets of 7, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Sit-up - 4 sets of 10, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Air Squat - 4 sets of 15, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Stretch - 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    
     <ul class="pw"><p><b>Week 2</b></p>
    <li>Run - 1 Mile, 10:00 pace, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Air Squat - 5 sets of 20, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Stretch - 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul class="pw"><p><b>Week 5</b></p>

    <li>Air Squat - 5 sets of 25, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Stretch - 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    
     <ul class="pw"><p><b>Week 6 and Beyond</b></p>
    <li>Run - 2 Mile, 8:30 pace, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Push-up - 5 sets of 16, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Sit-up - 5 sets of 20, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Air Squat - 5 sets of 25, Mon/Wed/Fri</li>
    <li>Stretch - 5 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>After this point, you should find a dramatic change in your physical and mental state! You can keep the same routine, or adjust it further based on your ability. </p>
