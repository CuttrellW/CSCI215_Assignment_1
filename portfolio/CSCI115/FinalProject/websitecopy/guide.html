<h2>College Survival Guide</h2><hr>

    <p>Being successful in college requires more than just completing the assignments and exams. To make the most out of your education, and to strengthen your GPA, there are five important points to remember:</p>

    </ol>

    
    <br><h3 id="time">1. Practice Time Management</h3>
    <p>Arguably the most important key to having a successful education is time management. Distractions and procrastination can and will take a toll on your productivity and also your <a href="mind.html">mental health.</a> If you have a track record of wasting time or procrastinating, don't worry, as mentioned before these habits can be fixed through practice.</p>

    <p>One of the ways to effectively manage your time is to know whats ahead and <a href="#organ">write things down.</a> It's very helpful to write assignments and important dates down as they are given to you, or to break down larger assignments into pieces that can be managed with much more ease.</p><br>
    
    <h3 id="organ">2. Get organized</h3>
    <p>Another important key to is to be as organized as possible. This not only applies to your studies but to all aspects of college life. As mentioned before, writing things down will help immensely, as there is there is simply too much to college life to keep track of entirely in your head. </p>
    
    <p>There are several different methods and tools you can use to help organize your life. One option is to buy a paper planner and write down assignments, exams, and events in the corresponding dates. You can also dedicate some space on a wall or somewhere you will see frequently and place reminders and notes on them. Another good option is to use one of several organization mobile apps, that will alert you when important dates or times are coming up.</p>
    
    <h3 id="study">3. Study Smart</h3>
    <p>Often times when people think of college they imagine long nights or nights of hours stacked upon hours of staring at the inside of books. While this can be a reality for some individuals, this outcome can be quite easily avoided. Like many elements of life, quality is more important than quantity. If you study smart, you will not have to sit and read out of a book for hours on end.</p>
    
    <p>The most important part of smart studying is to <a href="#focus">stay focused.</a> In order to truly study smart, you must avoid all distractions. One way to practice overcoming distractions is to use a timer. You can use a technique called the 'Power 60' or 'Power 30' where you work for a specified time completely uninterrupted, and then after the time is up you can allow yourself a break. While breaks are in fact important to smart studying, they should be kept completely separate from the time when you are working/studying.</p>
    
    <p>Studying smart means using your time effectively to understand the materials. If you find yourself falling a bit behind, do not panic- just meet with your professor during office hours. Never underestimate the power of extra help- it is extremely rare for a student who attends office hours and gets the extra help they need to do poorly or fail a class. The short amount of time in office hours is almost always the most efficient way to catch up on course material.</p>
    
    <h3 id="focus">4. Take (Mindful) Notes</h3>
    <p>Notetaking is essential for academic success- depending on the type of class, you may be taking mental notes as you complete a class activity, or writing down important points as you listen to the professor. Similar to studying, notetaking is practice that has been approached a certain way, because bad notetaking is quite common. The main difference between bad notetaking and good notetaking is simply the amount of attention that you are giving. This is also called <a href="mind.html">Mindfulness,</a> and you can find much more on practicing mindfulness here on this site.
    </p>
    <p>No matter your method for taking notes, the important part is stay focused. Mindlessly copying words that are written on the board or spoken by the professor will  limit your ability to study and do well in that course. Remember that taking notes is for you and you only. Make it personal- you know what you may struggle to remember and what you may not need to be reminded of. Use silly analogies or imagery to remember the parts of a topic. Whatever methods you use, just be sure to listen and understand what is being discussed, and it will always pay off in the future.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="social">5. Be Involved and Have Fun</h3>
    <p>The last important key to academic success is to be social and have fun. College is one of the most socially active settings that a person can find themselves in, but don't be overwhelmed by this, as it is also the most accepting. It's the perfect time to network yourself and meet tons of new people. This can also help you by getting close to those who are in the same field of study, so you can work together to succeed in your classes.</p>
    <p>It's also important for an individual to get involved. College is full of opportunity to get involved in a wide variety of programs, so its easy to find a group or organization that fits your interests. </p>
   <p> While college is an important time for any individual who enrolls, it is also one of the most fun and is meant to be enjoyed- so be sure to reward your hard work with some time for enjoyment with friends or by yourself.</p>
